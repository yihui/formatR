Description: Provides a function tidy_source() to format R source code. Spaces
    and indent will be added to the code automatically, and comments will be
    preserved under certain conditions, so that R code will be more
    human-readable and tidy. There is also a Shiny app as a user interface in
    this package (see tidy_app()).
