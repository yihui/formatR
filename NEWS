		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 1.4

NEW FEATURES

  o `tidy_source()` can preserve line breaks in character strings in source code

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the deprecated functions tidy.source(), tidy.dir(), and tidy.eval() have
  been removed; use tidy_source(), tidy_dir() and tidy_eval() instead

  o comments that begin with `#+` or `#-` are no longer wrapped; such comments
  are treated as knitr chunk options in `knitr::spin()` (#52)

BUG FIXES

  o `tidy_source()` should not write an extra space to the last line of code
  (thanks, @mr-karan, #49)

  o long strings (> 1000 characters) in source code can be preserved now
  (thanks, @jholtman, #50)

  o `tidy_source()` might move any lines of code starting with `else` back to
  the previous lines (thanks, @Auburngrads, #51)

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 1.3

NEW FEATURES

  o `tidy_source()` can deal with multibyte characters that cannot represented
  in the system native encoding now (on Windows)

  o `usage()` works for functions obtained from `::` or `:::` now, e.g.
  `usage(formatR::tidy_source)`

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 1.2

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the minimal required R version is 3.0.2 now

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 1.1

NEW FEATURES

  o added a new argument `output` to usage()

BUG FIXES

  o fixed yihui/knitr#918: when code is NULL, parse() will hang (with a question
  mark waiting for input)

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 1.0

NEW FEATURES

  o added a function tidy_app() to replace tidy.gui() in previous versions:
  tidy_app() launches a Shiny app in the browser to reformat R code. The
  gWidgets interface (e.g. GTK+) is no longer supported. See
  https://yihui.shinyapps.io/formatR/ for a live demo.

BUG FIXES

  o the shebang #! is no longer treated as an R comment (thanks, Mirko
  Ebert, #36)

MAJOR CHANGES

  o three functions were renamed (from the `foo.bar` style to `foo_bar`):
  `tidy.source()` (`tidy_source()`), `tidy.dir()` (`tidy_dir()`), and
  `tidy.eval()` (`tidy_eval()`)

  o the arguments of tidy_source() were renamed: `keep.comment` was renamed to
  `comment`, `keep.blank.line` -> `blank`, `replace.assign` -> `arrow`,
  `left.brace.newline` -> `brace.newline`, and `reindent.spaces` -> `indent`;
  similarly, the corresponding global options were also renamed: now you should
  use `options(formatR.comment)` instead of `options(keep.comment)`,
  `keep.blank.line` -> `formatR.blank`, and so on; see `?tidy_source` and
  http://yihui.name/formatR for details

MINOR CHANGES

  o the usage() function returns the source code of the usage of a function
  now; in previous versions, it only returns NULL

  o added a new argument 'tidy' in usage() to make it possible not to
  reformat the usage code

  o tidy_source() may not work for R 3.0.0 or 3.0.1 if the code only
  contains comments due to a bug in base R, which has been fixed; if you use
  R 3.0, please upgrade to at least R 3.0.2 (R 2.15.x is not affected)

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.10

MINOR CHANGES

  o the argument 'replace.assign' in tidy.source() will be treated as FALSE
  if there is no = in the code, because there is no need to replace = in
  such cases (this slighly improves the performance)

  o the PDF vignette was removed, and only the Markdown vignette was kept in
  this package, which uses the vignette engine knitr::docco_linear; see
  vignette('formatR', package = 'formatR')

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.9

MAJOR CHANGES

  o tidy.source() uses utils::getParseData() to identify comments in R code
  under R 3.0.x, which is much more accurate than the regular expressions in
  previous versions; users are strongly recommended to try R 3.0.x (#25, #26)

  o changed the meaning of the argument 'width' in usage(); see documentation

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.8

MAJOR CHANGES

  o tidy.source(text = character(0)) returns character(0) instead of ''

  o removed the (dark voodoo) functions parse.tidy() and deparse.tidy() as
  well as the operator "%InLiNe_IdEnTiFiEr%"; they were designed for the
  pgfSweave package, which has been archived on CRAN for a long time

  o the function unmask.source() is no longer exported

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.7

BUG FIXES

  o backslashes in whole lines of comments can be correctly retained
  now (e.g. #' \code{1+1}) (thanks, KAPLAN Bernard)

  o the font button in tidy.gui() works again (#23) (thanks, Dason
  Kurkiewicz)

  o the option left.brace.newline was buggy; it did not work for empty
  lines

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the option keep.space in tidy.source() was removed; the spaces
  before comments will not be faithfully kept

NEW FEATURES

  o the number of spaces for indentation can be specified in
  tidy.gui()

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.6

NEW FEATURES

  o the replace.assign argument is much more reliable now; it is based
  on the codetools package (code analysis) instead of regular
  expressions (big thanks to Kohske Takahashi)

  o replace.assign also works when keep.comment=FALSE; in previous
  versions, replace.assign=TRUE only applies to keep.comment=TRUE

  o tidy.source() gained a new argument 'left.brace.newline'; when set
  to TRUE, the left curly brace { will be moved to a new line (#18)
  (thanks, Jared Lander)

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the 'text.tidy' component in the results of tidy.source() is a
  character vector of code blocks instead of code lines now, e.g. in
  previous versions, the result may be c('if (TRUE) {', '1', '}')
  (vector of length 3), but now it becomes 'if (TRUE) {\n1\n}'; each
  element of 'text.tidy' contains a minimal complete code block

  o potential dependency on the parser package has been removed
  (replaced by the codetools package); this also makes it more robust
  to use Unicode characters in R code now, see issue #13 for example

  o roxygen comments (#') will not be reflowed; this gives us control
  over which comments to be reflowed (sometimes we do not want
  comments to be wrapped and we can write them in the special roxygen
  comments)

MINOR CHANGES

  o the results of tidy.source() (a list) only contain text.tidy and
  text.mask now; begin.comment and end.comment were removed since they
  were not used anywhere

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.5

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the dependency on the parser package was removed because it was
  orphaned on CRAN; this affects two features: replace = with <- (the
  'replace.assign' option in tidy.source()) and the identification of
  inline comments; tidy.source() will still work in most cases, but
  please keep in mind that (1) 'replace.assign=TRUE' will not be
  entirely reliable without parser (so use with extreme caution if you
  do not have parser installed) (2) if you want to write # in a
  character string, you must use double quotes, e.g. "here is a #"
  will be fine whereas 'here is a #' is not; if you want to use quotes
  in comments, please always use single quotes, e.g. # 'single quotes'
  (inline comments that contain double quotes will be dropped); if the
  parser package is available in your system (e.g. you installed it
  from the archived source on CRAN), everything will be the same as
  before

  o the default value for 'envir' in tidy.eval() was changed from
  globalenv() to parent.frame()

MINOR CHANGES

  o \\t will no longer be replaced with \t when keep.space=TRUE
  because it is dangerous to do so; see #17 for an example

		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.4

NEW FEATURES

  o a new argument 'reindent.spaces' for tidy.source() to reindent the
  code with a specified number of spaces (e.g. 2)

  o comments will be reflowed as a whole block when possible (instead
  of being wrapped line by line); thanks, Paul Johnson

MAJOR CHANGES

  o when a comment block is reflowed, the second and following lines
  will not be indented

  o the default value of the 'width.cutoff' argument in tidy.source()
  is getOption('width') now; in the past it was 75% of that width
  which was less intuitive

  o part of the documentation of tidy.source() has been moved to
  https://github.com/yihui/formatR/wiki/

  o internally the comments are preserved by putting them in an
  expression invisible("# comments"); in past versions comments were
  retained in assignments; this change should not affect end users

BUG FIXES

  o fixed #16: \\ in comments are preserved correctly now


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.3-4

MINOR CHANGES

  o slight tweaks to the vignette (stopped Sweave from adding
  \usepackage{Sweave} which introduces ae by default)

  o fixed the error message in tidy.source(), pointing users to the
  wiki page on GitHub (thanks, Gabor Grothendieck)


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.3-3

MINOR CHANGES

  o functions unmask.source(), parse.tidy(), deparse.tidy() and the
  operator %InLiNe_IdEnTiFiEr% were marked as `internal' in
  documentation

  o the vignette is processed by the knitr package

  o fixed a buglet in usage() so it can process functions with dots
  correctly


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.3-2

MINOR CHANGES

  o the parser package is imported (in previous versions formatR
  depends on parser); thanks, Romain Francois


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.3-1

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

  o the function formatR() was renamed to tidy.gui() which is a more
  meaningful name since it is used to create a GUI

NEW FEATURES

  o usage() will tell if the function is S3

  o a wiki is set up as the manual for formatR:
  https://github.com/yihui/formatR/wiki

  o tidy.eval() can evaluate the code in a specified environment now;
  see the 'envir' argument

MINOR CHANGES

  o keep.blank.line is TRUE by default now (was FALSE in previous
  versions), i.e. blank lines are preserved by default


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.2-4

NEW FEATURES

  o a new function tidy.eval(): evaluate R code and insert the output
  masked in comments (following ##)

  o the empty lines before 'else' will be removed even if
  keep.blank.line = TRUE; it is ill-advised to use blank lines among
  incomplete code chunks, e.g.

  if (TRUE)

  {'this is a BAD style of R programming'}

  o tidy.source() reports the line number when errors occur, which can
  help users detect the problem in the R code more quickly (thanks,
  Hadley Wickham)


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.2-3

NEW FEATURES

  o 'else ...' will be moved back to the last line so that we will no
  longer see an 'else' statement in a new line


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.2-2

NEW FEATURES

    o formatR now uses the parser package to parse inline comments,
  which can guarantee that these comments will be correctly parsed (no
  longer uses the 'unsafe' regular expressions to parse comments, so
  forget about the previous rules of writing comments -- just write
  comments with an arbitrary number of spaces before # as you wish)

    o the use of parser also enabled a new feature: '=' can be
  replaced with '<-' wherever appropriate (for example, '=' in
  function arguments will not be replaced; only thoese equal signs
  which are used to assigning purposes can be replaced)

    o long roxygen comments will not be wrapped (i.e. comments begin
  with #' or ##')

MINOR CHANGES

    o fixed a minor problem in the function usage() (out --> output)

    o comments after { will be moved to the next line (in previous
  versions, these comments will cause errors)


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.2-1

MINOR CHANGES

    o the escape character '\' in comments of complete lines will be
  successfully preserved, which is especially useful for tidy.source()
  to format the roxygen comments since we usually write comments like
  "##' @author Someone \email{}" but "\e" is not a legal character in
  R (this will lead to errors in earlier versions of this package)


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.2-0

NEW FEATURES

    o a new function usage() to print the formatted usage of a function


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.1-9

NEW FEATURES

    o tidy.source() can wrap long comments into shorter ones now (this
  only applies to the whole lines of comments; the inline comments
  will not be wrapped since it is tricky to do so)

MINOR CHANGES

    o '\t' will be parsed to ' ' when 'keep.space' is TRUE in
  tidy.source() (this might be undesirable, though)


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.1-8

NEW FEATURES

    o new functions parse.tidy() and deparse.tidy() for the package
  pgfSweave to help tidy the source code in Sweave

    o a new function tidy.dir() to format all the R scripts under a
  directory

    o added a package vignette


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.1-7

NEW FEATURES

    o full support to multi-byte characters in the formatR() GUI

    o a new function unmask.source() to obtain the real source code
  from the masked source

    o a new operator '%InLiNe_IdEnTiFiEr%' designed mainly for
  pgfSweave (mask the inline comments)


		   CHANGES IN formatR VERSION 0.1-6

NEW FEATURES

    o the inline comments will also be preserved in most cases (in
  earlier versions, only single lines of comments are preserved)

    o tidy.source() gained a new argument 'text' to accept a character
  vector as the source code

    o multi-byte characters are partially supported in the formatR() GUI
  now (full support will come in 0.1-7)
